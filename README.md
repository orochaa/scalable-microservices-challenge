# üß© Mini Course: Scalable Microservices

This repository contains the source code and infrastructure for a hands-on mini course on **Scalable Microservices**, focusing on modern architecture, asynchronous integration, observability, and cloud deployment using AWS.

---

## ‚úÖ Goal

During this course, we built an application composed of **two independent microservices**, integrated through asynchronous messaging with RabbitMQ, exposed via API Gateway (Kong), using PostgreSQL for persistence, deployed on AWS ECS Fargate, and monitored through distributed observability.

---

## üß† Topics Covered

- Microservices using **NestJS** and **TypeScript**
- Asynchronous communication with **RabbitMQ**
- Integration via **API Gateway** using **Kong**
- Persistence with **PostgreSQL** and **Prisma ORM**
- Deployment on **AWS** using:
  - **Pulumi** (Infrastructure as Code)
  - **ECS Fargate**, **ECR**, and **Application Load Balancer**
- Observability with:
  - **Jaeger** for development
  - **Grafana** for production
- Eventual consistency and data replication between services
- Shared `contracts` package with interfaces and message topics
- Documentation using Swagger integrated with NestJS

---

## üöÄ Running the Project Locally

To spin up all services for local development, simply run:

```bash
./dev.sh
```

This script will start:

- The microservices
- RabbitMQ
- PostgreSQL
- Kong API Gateway
- Jaeger for distributed tracing
- All supporting services via Docker

---

## üì¶ API Usage Example

You can interact with the **Orders API** by sending a `POST` request to the following route:

```
POST http://localhost:8000/orders/orders
```

> This route is exposed via **Kong API Gateway** and forwarded to the **Orders microservice**.

### üîß Request Body

Send the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "customerId": "uuid-here", # A valid UUID representing the customer.
  "amount": 100 # A number indicating the order value.
}
```

### üß™ cURL Example

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/orders/orders \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "customerId": "'"$(uuid)"'",
    "amount": 100
  }'
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Behavior

When this request is received:

1. The **Orders API** stores the order in its PostgreSQL database.
2. It publishes an event to **RabbitMQ**, following the contract defined in the shared `contracts` package.
3. The **Invoices API** consumes the event and creates an associated invoice automatically.

This demonstrates asynchronous communication and eventual consistency between services using a message broker.

## üîó UI Access & Dashboards

Once the system is running (`./dev.sh`), you can access the following dashboards and tools in your browser:

| Service               | URL                                                                        | Notes                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **API Gateway**       | [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)                             | Entry point for all API routes    |
| **Orders API Docs**   | [http://localhost:8000/orders/docs](http://localhost:8000/orders/docs)     | Swagger UI for Orders API         |
| **Invoices API Docs** | [http://localhost:8000/invoices/docs](http://localhost:8000/invoices/docs) | Swagger UI for Invoices API       |
| **Jaeger Tracing**    | [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686)                           | View distributed traces           |
| **Kong Dashboard**    | [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)                             | Kong Admin UI                     |
| **RabbitMQ**          | [http://localhost:15672](http://localhost:15672)                           | User: `guest` / Password: `guest` |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure Docker is running and `./dev.sh` has been executed before accessing these interfaces.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Deployment

Infrastructure is provisioned using **Pulumi**, which sets up:

- ECS Clusters (Fargate)
- ECR Repositories
- Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- VPC, Subnets, and other networking resources

---

## üìä Observability

- **Development:** Uses **Jaeger** for distributed tracing.
- **Production:** Uses **Grafana** dashboards, with support for structured logging and performance metrics.
